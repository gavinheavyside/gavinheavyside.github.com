The 4th [Hadoop Users Group UK](http://huguk.org/) meetup took place
last night at the [Skillsmatter Exchange](http://skillsmatter.com/go/find-us).

Aaron Kimball of
[Cloudera](www.cloudera.com) talked about
[Sqoop](http://www.cloudera.com/developers/downloads/sqoop/), and Tim
Sell of [Last.fm](http://last.fm) talked about how they use Hive. Ben
"Shevek" Mankin of Karmasphere gave a Lightning talk introducing
[Karmasphere Studio](http://www.karmasphere.com/products/) which looks
great, and then I gave a quick overview of
[Cascalog](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/introducing-cascalog/).

I think the combination of two unfamiliar technologies (Clojure and Datalog)
was probably a bit much for most people, but it was good to be able to
talk about something new.
